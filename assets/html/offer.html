    <h1>NEWS</h1><h2><strong>Gaza battle rages as Israel 
      targets UN refugee agency</strong></h2>
      <br><p>GAZA: Intense fighting raged 
        on Saturday in the Gaza city of 
        Khan Yunis, the main theatre of 
        conflict where the Israeli army is 
        targeting the Palestinian groups.
        The unabated hostilities came 
        a day after the UN’s International 
        Court of Justice in The Hague 
        ruled Israel must prevent 
        possible acts of genocide in the 
        conflict but stopped short of 
        calling for a ceasefire.
        Tensions rose between 
        Israel and the UN agency for 
        Palestinian refugees after Israel 
        alleged several UNRWA staff 
        were involved in the attack of 
        October 7, leading some key 
        donor countries to suspend 
        funding. 
        Foreign Minister Israel Katz 
        said on Saturday that Israel wants 
        to ensure the UN agency, with 
        tens of thousands of staff in the 
        territory, “will not be a part of 
        the day after” the bloodiest ever 
        Gaza war.
        Alarm has grown over the 
        plight of civilians in Khan Yunis. 
        Images showed thousands of 
        civilians, among them women 
        and children, fleeing the city on 
        foot as an Israeli tank loomed 
        behind them.
        “They besieged us, so we fled,” 
        said Tahani al Najjar, who left 
        Khan Yunis with her daughter. 
        Gaza civil defence spokesman 
        Mahmud Bassal said the 
        displaced endured incessant cold 
        rain and warned of the “spread of 
        contagious diseases”.
        The health ministry in Gaza 
        said at least 135 people were 
        killed in Khan Yunis overnight. 
        The government said “massive 
        tank bombardment” targeted a 
        refugee camp in the city and its 
        Nasser hospital.
        Issuing a highly anticipated 
        ruling on Friday, the UN’s top 
        court said Israel must prevent 
        genocidal acts in Gaza and allow 
        humanitarian aid into the narrow 
        strip of land which has been 
        under bombardment and siege 
        for months. SEE ALSO P5</p>
