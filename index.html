          <strong>Gaza battle rages as Israel targets UN refugee agency</strong>
        </h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          GAZA: Intense fighting raged on Saturday in the Gaza city of Khan
          Yunis, the main theatre of conflict where the Israeli army is
          targeting the Palestinian groups. The unabated hostilities came a day
          after the UN’s International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled
          Israel must prevent possible acts of genocide in the conflict but
          stopped short of calling for a ceasefire. Tensions rose between Israel
          and the UN agency for Palestinian refugees after Israel alleged
          several UNRWA staff were involved in the attack of October 7, leading
          some key donor countries to suspend funding. Foreign Minister Israel
          Katz said on Saturday that Israel wants to ensure the UN agency, with
          tens of thousands of staff in the territory, “will not be a part of
          the day after” the bloodiest ever Gaza war. Alarm has grown over the
          plight of civilians in Khan Yunis. Images showed thousands of
          civilians, among them women and children, fleeing the city on foot as
          an Israeli tank loomed behind them. “They besieged us, so we fled,”
          said Tahani al Najjar, who left Khan Yunis with her daughter. Gaza
          civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said the displaced endured
          incessant cold rain and warned of the “spread of contagious diseases”.
          The health ministry in Gaza said at least 135 people were killed in
          Khan Yunis overnight. The government said “massive tank bombardment”
          targeted a refugee camp in the city and its Nasser hospital. Issuing a
          highly anticipated ruling on Friday, the UN’s top court said Israel
          must prevent genocidal acts in Gaza and allow humanitarian aid into
          the narrow strip of land which has been under bombardment and siege
          for months. SEE ALSO P5
